In the folders you will find the various **ruby** scripts for converting
ingforms data to xdf-xml.

The results of the **ruby** scripts are always valid rdf-xml, but changing about how it should be modeled leeds to the recommendation not to use these ruby scripts anymore.  
Scripts that give somewhat better results are the **python** scripts, found in 'godsdienstpolitiek' and 'sport' (but these also need to be improved).

In the folders you will find the various **ruby** scripts for converting
ingforms data to xdf-xml.

The results of the ruby are always valid rdf-xml, but changing about how it shoul be modeled leeds to the recommendation not to use these ruby scripts anymore.  
Scripts that give somewhat better results can be found in 'godsdienstpolitiek' and 'sport'; in both cases **python** scripts (but these can also be improved).
